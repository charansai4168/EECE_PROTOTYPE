For example, in the realization of 5G, several waveforms are proposed. These waveforms are promising, but not without their respective drawbacks. Considering the ever-increasing demands, these drawbacks might make them unsuitable in higher generations of mobile networks such as 6G. Wavelet-based waveforms are considerable alternatives in meeting the ever-growing demands of future mobile communication. In this work, we investigate a wavelet Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (WOFDM) algorithm that automatically adjusts to the constellation order according to the channel state. This we refer to as Link Adaptive Wavelet OFDM (LA-WOFDM). With this, we achieve a spectral efficient waveform while maintaining a balance in link quality. A spectral efficient waveform system yields higher power efficiency. Finally, our results show that Link Adaptive Wavelet-OFDM can compete with the state of the art.","2576-8964","978-1-6654-0505-8","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP51612.2020.9317398","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61370073); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2007AA01Z423); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317398","Link-adaptive;Wavelet-OFDM;5G;6G","Modulation;5G mobile communication;Signal to noise ratio;Adaptive systems;Bit error rate;Wireless communication;Phase shift keying","","","","10","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm firstly uses guided filtering to smooth the hazing image, then adopts dual-tree complex wavelet transform to decompose the hazing image into low-frequency and high-frequency sub-band components, and then uses the dark channel prior model to process the low-frequency sub-band of the image, finally adopts inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transform to get the dehazed image. The dark channel prior comes from the statistical law of the outdoor fog-free image datasets. Since dual-tree complex wavelet transform has approximate translation advantages such as degeneration, higher positioning accuracy, computational efficiency, and guided filtering can increase the scope of application of haze removal, which can greatly reduce the optimization time of initial transmittance and the complexity of the entire algorithm. Therefore, the new proposed algorithm outperforms traditional dark channel prior based defogging algorithm.

Based on the sparse representation principle, an artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization sparsity method of the Laplace wavelet dictionary is proposed to realize the transient characteristic components in the signal extraction. Sparse decomposition with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is a signal adaptive decomposition algorithm, and it is one of the effective methods for weak feature extraction under strong noise background. Aiming to select and construct an over-complete dictionary for the sparse representation of rolling bearing fault vibration signals, based on the analysis of fault signals' characteristics, an improved Laplace wavelet atomic library was constructed. For solving extensive calculation and low efficiency of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, this paper combines the ABC algorithm's fast operation characteristics to select the improved Laplace wavelet atom that best matches the fault through the inner product operation, thereby improving the calculation efficiency. Experiments show that the method has a proper matching with the early weak fault signals of rolling bearings and can adequately characterize fault information and judge the fault type more accurately.","2576-8964","978-1-6654-0505-8","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP51612.2020.9317432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317432","Fault diagnosis;Improved Laplace wavelet;Sparse decomposition;Artificial bee colony algorithm;Rolling bearing","Dictionaries;Matching pursuit algorithms;Vibrations;Rolling bearings;Artificial bee colony algorithm;Optimization;Time-frequency analysis","","2","","11","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method is devised for low THz band (i.e., 0.2 THz). Inspired by classical Fresnel formula, the method utilizes circularly polarized antenna to excite circularly polarized wave. Then, the reflected s-polarized wave and p-polarized wave are directly received through respective linearly polarized antenna. The refractive index thus can be easily obtained from the Brewster's angle of the object, which is the incident angle yielding the maximal s-component to p-component ratio. The overall measurement reliability is guaranteed from both the transmitting end and the receiving end. The transmitted THz wave is collimated and focused through the properly optical path for anti-interference, while the s-component and the p-component are received based on two balanced paths against the stimulation and disturbance. A high-resistance silicon is taken as a specimen, whose refractive index is estimated as 3.37 on average in 75 GHz-110 GHz band. This high agreement with the result measured by THz time domain spectroscopy verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2576-8964","978-1-6654-0505-8","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP51612.2020.9317372","National key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFF01013003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61731020,61605113,61601291); 111 Project(grant numbers:D18014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317372","Polarized THz wave;Refractive index;Fresnel formula;Brewster's angle","Refractive index;Reflection;Transmission line measurements;Silicon;Metals;Antenna measurements;Surface waves","","","","17","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One main concern is those undesired or irrelevant recommendations, not only wasting our time, but they also cost media companies millions of dollars every year. Considering this issue, we proposed a tunable and explainable recommendation system where the attributes that determined the recommendations are explainable and tunable for every individual consumer. Irrelevant recommendations waste the consumer's time and the company's money, but if we put the power of the recommendations in the consumer's hands, we have a win-win situation.

The proposed framework integrates non-parametric dirichlet model with language translation component (NDML) to cluster the temporal stream of short text data, and transforms the cluster feature into uniform language vector representation. We conducted experiments on real time crisis data to evaluate the accuracy of our proposed model.","2576-8964","978-1-6654-0505-8","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP51612.2020.9317342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317342","Dirichlet model;Temporal data;Stream clustering;Multilingual Text","Mathematical model;Data models;Task analysis;Social networking (online);Vocabulary;Sensitivity;Blogs","","6","","12","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper analyses the efficacy of utilizing transformer encoders on the ISEAR dataset for detecting emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, sadness, fear, joy, shame, and guilt). This work proposes a two-stage architecture. The first stage has the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which outputs into the second stage consisting of a Bi-LSTM classifier for predicting their emotion classes accordingly. The results, outperforming that of the state-of-the-art, with a higher weighted average F1 score of 0.73, become the new state-of-the-art in detecting emotions on the ISEAR dataset.","2576-8964","978-1-6654-0505-8","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP51612.2020.9317523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317523","Naturallanguage processing;Transfer learning;Emotion detection;BERT","Bit error rate;Training;Testing;Semantics;Data models;Computational modeling;Natural language processing","","10","","22","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work we proposed a generic plant disease recognition architecture with a two path way Encoder GAN data generation network. This network incorporated conditional sample generation and conditional reconstruction tasks that enabled the generation of unseen data feature. Using the tomato samples extracted from PlantVillage dataset, we were able to efficiently generate plausible images that boosted plant disease recognition. We tested the performance of our approach on popular CNN architectures such as ResNet50, GoogLeNet, VGG19 and AlexNet. The experiment result proved that the approach achieved good result both in terms of generation quality and plant disease classification performance compared to existing state of the art works.

However, DL always needs a large number of labeled training data which are not usually available for gastroscopic image analysis. Therefore, the pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models are important. The transfer learning (TL) method could leverage the pre-trained model in natural images to gastroscopic images. In this paper, we have studied different TL methods on small dataset of gastroscopic images. We have fine-tuned the current deep CNNs: EfficientNet, ResNet and DenseNet on three kinds of gastroscopic images from kvasirv2 dataset. The results demonstrated that the pre-trained models of current deep CNNs can get considerable classification results on gastroscopic images with small dataset.","2576-8964","978-1-6654-0505-8","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP51612.2020.9317450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317450","Gastroscopic image;Classification;Deep learning;Transfer learning;Lesion","Lesions;Training;Cancer;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;Pattern recognition;Computer vision","","3","","15","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These representations can solve two problems, the first is to avoid polysemy, the second is to capture remote features. Our representations are learned from a Chinese semantic dependency model and a normal word embedding model (e.g.,CBOW or Skip-gram). Using CBOW or Skip-gram model, the word representations can get some semantic information from the position of words. Semantic dependency model can find different word pairs in the sentence and predict the semantic relationship between each word pair. The first word of each word pair represents the current word, and the second word represents the target word. By fusing the semantic information after semantic analysis into the basic word representations, we can get more accurate and dynamic word representations. More importantly, we have achieved advanced results when we use these word representations in sentiment classification task and subject classification task.","2576-8964","978-1-6654-0505-8","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP51612.2020.9317476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317476","Word representation;Semantic dependency;Feature fusion;Sentiment classification;Subject classification","Semantics;Task analysis;Training;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Syntactics;Matrix converters","","","","18","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
